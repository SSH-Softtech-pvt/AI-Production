# Bio Sanjeevni AI Platform

This repository hosts all AI initiatives across frontend, backend, ML/RAG, DevOps, and governance. Each top-level directory owns a specific concern so that teams can scale independently while sharing standards.

## Top-Level Overview
- `environment/` – runtime definitions, infrastructure-as-code, monitoring.
- `frontend/` – user-facing apps, shared UI packages, and tests.
- `backend/` – services, APIs, workers, shared libraries, and docs.
- `ml/` – data, training, evaluation, deployment pipelines, and notebooks.
- `rag/` – retrieval pipelines, vector stores, evaluations, prompts, agents.
- `platform/` – global capabilities: feature flags, identity, compliance, security.
- `devops/` – CI/CD pipelines, quality gates, automation.
- `docs/` – architecture references, processes, product notes, legal artifacts.
- `research/` – papers, experiments, prototypes.
- `samples/` – reference integrations and API snippets.
- `tools/` – CLI, debugging, and performance utilities.
- `tests/` – cross-cutting integration/system/load suites.
- `assets/` – branding, diagrams, presentations.

Each folder should contain its own README describing conventions, owners, and onboarding steps once implementation begins.
